    question: "Is Glazed Client safe to use?",
    answer: "Glazed is an open-source project, meaning anyone can audit the code. However, using any client on a server with anti-cheat always carries a risk. Use at your own discretion."
  },
  {
    question: "Does it work on other servers?",
    answer: "While Glazed is specifically optimized for DonutSMP, most features (Crystal Aura, Auto Totem, Utility) will work on any vanilla or semi-vanilla server."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I install it?",
    answer: "You need Fabric Loader and Meteor Client installed first. Then, drop the Glazed.jar file into your mods folder."
  },
  {
    question: "My game crashed! What do I do?",
    answer: "Ensure you are using the correct Minecraft version (1.21.4) and have the latest Fabric API installed. If issues persist, join our Discord for support."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it free?",
    answer: "Yes, Glazed is 100% free and open-source."
