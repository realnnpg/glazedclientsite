            <h3>1. Data Collection</h3>
            <p>Glazed Client ("the Software") prioritizes user privacy. We do not collect, store, or transmit personal data, usage statistics, or telemetry to external servers.</p>

            <h3>2. Local Storage</h3>
            <p>The Software may store configuration files and settings locally on your device (e.g., in your `.minecraft` folder). These files are strictly for the functionality of the client and are not shared.</p>

            <h3>3. Third-Party Services</h3>
            <p>The Software depends on third-party libraries and loaders (e.g., Fabric, Meteor Client). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third-party services. We encourage you to review their respective privacy policies.</p>

            <h3>4. Updates</h3>
            <p>Any changes to this privacy policy will be posted on this page. Since the Software does not have an auto-update mechanism that fetches data from us, you are encouraged to check this page periodically.</p>

            <h3>5. Contact</h3>
            <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us via our Discord community.</p>
